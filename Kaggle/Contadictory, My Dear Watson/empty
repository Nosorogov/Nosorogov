If you have a pair of sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis), there are three ways they could be related: one could entail the other, one could contradict the other, or they could be unrelated. There is the NLI model that assigns labels of 0, 1, or 2 (corresponding to entailment, neutral, and contradiction) to pairs of premises and hypotheses. The train and test set include text in fifteen different languages.
